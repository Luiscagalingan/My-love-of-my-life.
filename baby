	<h1>Farewell, My Love</h1>
	<p>As I write this letter, I can't help but feel a heavy heart. I never thought the day would come when we would have to say goodbye.</p>
	<p>I will always cherish the memories we made together, the laughter we shared, and the love that bloomed between us.</p>
	<p>I know that this is not the end, but merely a new beginning. I will carry you in my heart always, and I know that you will do the same.</p>
	<p>Thank you for being a part of my life. I will never forget you.</p>
	<p>With all my love,</p>
	<p>[Your Name]</p>
